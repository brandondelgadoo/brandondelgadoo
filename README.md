## Hi there 👋
My name is Brandon Delgado. I am a third year student at FIU pursuing both a Masters and Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
I am currently working on a couple school projects, I don't know the ideas or problems they're going solve yet but I am very excited.
I love playing video games, going to the gym, woprking out, playing basketball and playing golf.
I am also open to working on any projects if you need more people to join so let me know and I'll happily contribute.
